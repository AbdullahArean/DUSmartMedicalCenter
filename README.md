# SmartMedicalCenter
## Introduction

The development of a **web-based hospital management system** for the **Medical Center of Dhaka University** is an important project that will ease access to patient data and make the hospital paperless. The system will allow **admins, doctors, and patients** to access and manage patient data in a secure and efficient manner.

This project is motivated by the need for a better way to manage patient data in a hospital setting. The current system is **paper-based**, which is inefficient and error-prone. The proposed system will be a **web-based application** that will allow users to access patient data from anywhere. This will improve the efficiency of the hospital's operations and make it easier for patients to access their medical records.

The proposed system will use **design patterns** to improve the quality of the design and codebase. Design patterns are **reusable solutions to common problems in software development**. They can help to make the system more modular, reusable, and maintainable.

## Project Objectives

* **Specific:** The project will develop a web-based hospital management system that will allow admins, doctors, and patients of the Medical Center of Dhaka University to access and manage patient data in a fully paperless manner.
* **Measurable:** The project will be measured by the number of users who use the system, the number of transactions that are processed, and the satisfaction of users with the system.
* **Achievable:** The project is achievable with the resources that are available. The project team has experience in developing web applications, and the project scope is realistic.
* **Relevant:** The project is relevant to the needs of the Medical Center of Dhaka University. The hospital has expressed a need for a better way to manage patient data in a fully paperless manner.
* **Time-bound:** The project will be completed within 3 months. This timeline is realistic given the scope of the project and the resources that are available.

## Software Development Methodology

The project will use an agile methodology, specifically **Scrum**. This will allow the team to adapt to changes as they arise and to deliver the project on time and within budget. The team is confident that they can use agile methodologies to successfully deliver the hospital management system project on time, within budget, and to a high quality.

## Scope of the Project

The project will include the following **functional requirements**:

* **Admin can:**
    * Sign up and login to the system.
    * Register, view, approve, reject, and delete doctors.
    * Admit, view, approve, reject, and discharge patients.
    * Generate and download invoice PDFs.
    * View, book, and approve appointments.
* **Doctor can:**
    * Apply for a job in the hospital and login to the system (after approval by admin).
    * View their patient details (symptoms, name, mobile number) assigned to them by admin.
    * View their discharged patients list.
    * View their appointments booked by admin.
    * Delete their appointments when they have attended them.
* **Patient can:**
    * Create an account for admission to the hospital and login to the system (after approval by admin).
    * View their assigned doctor's details (specialization, mobile number, address).
    * View the status of their booked appointments (pending/confirmed by admin).
    * Book appointments (approval required by admin).
    * View/download invoice PDFs (only when they are discharged by admin).

The project will also include the following **non-functional requirements**:

* The system must be **secure** and protect patient data.
* The system must be **scalable** to handle a large number of users.
* The system must be **available 24/7**.

## Technical Details

The project will be developed using the following **technologies**:

* **Python**
* **HTML**
* **CSS**
* **Django**
* **xhtml2pdf**

The project will be hosted on a web server with enough resources to handle the traffic.

## Timeline

The project will be completed in 3 months, with the following milestones:

* **Month 1:** Requirement analysis, design, and wireframing
* **Month 2:** Implementation and testing
* **Month 3:** Deployment and user acceptance testing

## Conclusion

The development of a web-based hospital management system is a valuable project that will improve the efficiency of the Medical Center of Dhaka University. The proposed system will use design patterns to improve the quality of the design and codebase. The project will be executed using an agile methodology, which will allow the team to adapt to changes as they arise.
